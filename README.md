# Nexflix

A personal project inspired by Netflix. A React, Node.js & Mongodb Atlas app with usage of TMDB api.

#### Here's a link to the website:

#### React, Redux, react-router, styled-components, Material UI, react-lazy-load-image-component, Node.js, Express, Mongodb Atlas, TMDB api

Getting deeper with user management and external api.

The frontend is a Typescript Create React App with a redux store, the design is inspired by Netflix. In this project I focused on user management - managing an account with nested users, as well as incorporating my own api with calls to the TMDB api.

I'm available for any questions or ideas to improve :)
